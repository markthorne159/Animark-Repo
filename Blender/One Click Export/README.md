### One Click Export Addon For Blender

I've spent a lot of time working in Blender and often found myself working on models for games that had to be tweaked and exported back into my project multiple times and after a while I started finding Blenders built in export system to be a bit of a pain. While it works in the same way as exporting in most other programs I began finding it a little bit annoying having to go back through multiple screens in order to export the model after making a change that could sometimes be as simple as changing some normals or slightly extruding part of the mesh.

To try and minimize the export process I came up with an idea to see if I could develop a script/addon that would enable me to complete the export progress in a single click, which resulte in this addon.

Once the addon is installed pressing 'T' in object mode will open up the normal transform panel. At the bottom of the panel will be a new tab labelled "One Export". Clicking on this will dispaly a new set of options.
