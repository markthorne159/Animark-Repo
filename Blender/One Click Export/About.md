### One Click Export Addon For Blender

I've spent a lot of time working in Blender and often found myself working on models for games that had to be tweaked and exported back into my project multiple times and after a while I started finding lenders built in export system to be a bit of a pain. While it works in the same way as exporting in most other programs I started to find it a little bit annoying having to go back through multiple screens in order to export the model after making a change that could sometimes be as simple as changing some normals.

To try and minimize the export process I came up with an idea, what if I could create a button which I could use to set the name of the file and the place I wanted it to be exported to and then use this button to export whatever I was working on with a single click? Thats where this addon comes in.
