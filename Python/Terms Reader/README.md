# Terms Reader

We all know far to well of the lengthy multipage 'Terms and Conditions' documents
that we're always greeted with when we sign up for new accounts. But the thing is... do you even consider reading them?

This app is here to save you the hassle! You can scan terms and conditions to look for a series of preset phrases and words or specify your own words and phrases for the app to look for. To save you from typing in the same new phrases or words to search for each time you use the app you can also add your most used words to the list of preset words and phrases that come with the app. 

Alongisde the simple scans you can also grab anything the app outputs and save it to a separate file for future use.

Using the app is easy. Simply click on the icon, wait for the app to boot and you're ready to go!
An important note however is to make sure that the file you wish to scan is in the same directory as the app to ensure 
the application can find and read the file.

Currently the app can only read from text files with the ability to grab terms and conditions directly from a web page being
added in the future.

Using the application.

Each time you open the app you'll be greeted by a small window which prompts you to type in the name of the file you want to scan.

Clicking 'Set' will set your chosen file and open up the main window. The main window shows a list of each of the terms or words the app will search for, an entry box for you to declare a specific phrase or word to search for and an entry box for you to add your own words and phrases to the list provided. There is also a small label above the 'Scan' button displaying the name of the file you set for the scan.
