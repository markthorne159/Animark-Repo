# Terms Reader

We all know far to well of the lengthy multipage 'Terms and Conditions' documents
that we're always greeted with when we sign up for new accounts. But the thing is... do you even consider reading them?

This app is here to save you the hassle! You can scan terms and conditions to look for a series of preset phrases and words or specify your own words and phrases for the app to look for. To save you from typing in the same new phrases or words to search for each time you use the app you can also and your most used words to the list of preset words and phrases that come with the app. 

As well as simple scans you can also grab anything the app outputs and write it to a separate file for future use.

Using the app is easy. Simply click on the icon, wait for the app to boot and you're ready to go!
An important note however is to make sure that the file you wish to scan is in the same directory as the app to ensure 
the application can find and read the file.
