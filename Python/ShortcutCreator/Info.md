## Shortcut Creator

I created this widget/application with the essential aim of speeding up or increasing my productivity.
Whenever I've been working on my assorted projects I began to notice that I spent a lot of time repeatedly
traversing through multiple folders in order to get to a single file. This was a process that quickly
became tedious. Of course I could have simply created a Desktop shortcut that lead directly to that folder
however that would have lead to my Desktop quickly being flooded with multiple shortcuts leading to all sorts of folders.
Instead I decided to create my own little application, something which would also act as good practice.

The application functions as a Desktop widget to make accessing your most used folders much easier.
Instead of having to navigate through multiple folders to reach one place this app can store a path to multiple folders
which can be accessed with the click of a button. 

There are two versions of the app. One is a GUI application and the other is a command line interface.
The GUI application displays a list of your already created shortcuts each time you start it up and currently includes
buttons to enable you to add or remove shortcuts. The command line version requires a little bit more interaction as it includes
commands that enable you to view a list of your current shortcuts, set a new shortcut by adding a "path", remove shortcuts you no
longer want or need and change shortcuts if a folders path has changed.
